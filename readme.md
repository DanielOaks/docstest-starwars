# Star Wars API Tutorial

The [tutorial file](./tutorial.md) tells you how to make use of the [Star Wars API](https://swapi.dev/).

Below are the decisions I made while putting this together.

## Commentary

The first thing I ask when looking at this project is "What kind of tutorial?". This lets me put together a short list of references for how my tutorial should look and feel. Note, these don't need to be perfect â€“ they just give us a rough reference of what to include, how to talk to the audience, etc.

Here are my references for this project:

## index.html and main.js

- Styling
  - **Why TailwindCSS?** I've been using TailwindCSS lately for a few projects, and have been liking it! I decided to use it here as well. It's a little painful because the intellisense in VS Code doesn't work (you need a proper project setup to have it work, not just using the CDN), but it produces some simple, nice-looking results easily.
  - **Why so simple?** Since this is more of a technical writing task, I didn't want to go overboard on the design. Nice, simple, with small bits of colour to separate characters from planets.
